# SEA-ME.github.io


After complete all the SEA-ME projects, I have free times about 2 weeks in germany.<br>
I decided to publish guidlines of SEA-ME as an E-Book style.<br>
It will be on github pages.<br>
<br>
And this will be the record of developing E-Book.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm currently doing personal project named 'newjeans_project'<br>
<br>
I can also connect my project at here.<br>
